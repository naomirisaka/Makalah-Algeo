# Aircraft Dynamic System Stability for Autopilot Control Using Complex Eigenvalues 
> Makalah IF2123 Aljabar Linear dan Geometri
## Project Overview
This project uses the concept of complex eigenvalues to understand an aircraft dynamic system stability for autopilot control. The simulation replicates the functionality of an autopilot stabilization system, such as determining the system stability and recommending control corrections while the system is unstable, in order to achieve system stability.
